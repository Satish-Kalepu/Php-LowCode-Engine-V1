									<h6 style="font-size:20px">1.3. User Account</h6>
									<p class="left_p text-align-justify">In order to access and use certain sections and features of the BackendLessApps Services, you must first register and create an account with BackendLessApps ("<b>User Account</b>").</p>
									<p class="left_p text-align-justify">If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the BackendLessApps Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more - and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name.</p>
									<p class="left_p text-align-justify">Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust - as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.</p>
									<p class="left_p text-align-justify">You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the BackendLessApps Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company's) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us. </p>
									<p class="left_p text-align-justify">In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the principles set forth below.</p>
									<ol>
										<li><p>BackendLessApps will consider the owner of a <b>User Account, User Platform and/or User Content</b> created and/or uploaded to the relevant BackendLessApps Service, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in BackendLessApps's records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created.</p></li>
										<li><p>If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via a User Account, BackendLessApps will consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services ("<b>Billing Information</b>"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain's registration information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the www.whois.net website or on BackendLessApps's database, BackendLessApps will consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such domain, BackendLessApps will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User Platform connected to such domain. In event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, BackendLessApps shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the BackendLessApps Account as the owner of the User Platform.</p></li>
										<li><p>Not with standing the forgoing, BackendLessApps shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event BackendLessApps deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by BackendLessApps.  </p></li>

If BackendLessApps is obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, and whether or not such Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be reflected in the Invoice for such transaction. We recommend that you verify the existence of any additional fees you may be charged by third parties in connection with the purchase of Paid Services or in connection with the renewal thereof (such as international transaction fees, currency exchange fees or fees due to banks or credit card companies). BackendLessApps is not responsible for any such additional fees or costs.</p>

For example, if the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. Accordingly, where applicable, BackendLessApps will attempt to automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the Stored Card, within up-to two (2) weeks before such renewal period commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice.
